This approach allows organizations to avoid the potential pitfalls of transcribing totals and percentages by hand, supporting the continued accuracy and consistency of reporting on mission-critical metrics. This approach is possible because companies that host online data platforms (Procare, Qualtrics, etc.) typically publish APIs that allow their users to analyze relevant data directly from statistical analysis programs (like R) using required login credentials.\nIn the examples contained within this document, I pull information on companies in the S&P 500 market index from Wikipedia, which provides general information about the companies that constitute the S&P 500. This approach can be adapted to local reports on student enrollments and learning outcomes, among a variety of other applications."
